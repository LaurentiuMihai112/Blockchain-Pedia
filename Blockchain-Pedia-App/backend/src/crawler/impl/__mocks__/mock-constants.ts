        "en": "Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">smart contract platform</a> which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \r\n\r\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\r\n\r\nTechnological Innovation\r\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake algorithm</a>. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\r\n\r\nCardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\r\n\r\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\r\n\r\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\r\n\r\nConceptual Innovation\r\n\r\ni. Privacy and regulation\r\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\r\n\r\nii. Governance\r\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum's case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\r\n\r\niii. Funding\r\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\r\n\r\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\r\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\r\n\r\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\r\nEach cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/\">IOHK</a> specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> and many more.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\">Cardano Foundation</a>\r\nThe Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:\r\n\r\n1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications\r\n2. Be a community hub offering authoritative, timely information about the technology and Cardano’s wide-ranging potential\r\n3. Liaise and influence government and regulatory bodies, form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open source projects and aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for its long term success and critical in adoption and government engagement\r\n\r\nAreas of Focus:\r\n1. Cardano Protocol - We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.\r\n2. Cardano community - We support, grow and help educate the Cardano blockchain community.\r\n3. Cardano ecosystem - We work to expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem. This includes promoting Cardano as a platform for commercial entities and serving as an objective organization for enterprises interested in joining Cardano.\r\n4. Serving the wider blockchain community - We aim to influence and progress the emerging commercial and legislative landscape for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general. We proactively approach government and regulatory bodies and form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open-source projects.\r\n\r\nIOHK\r\nFounded in 2015 by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a> and <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/jeremy-wood/\">Jeremy Wood</a>, IOHK is a world-class engineering and technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to three billion people that don’t have them.

Cardano는 대규모 응용 프로그램을위한 준비가 완료된 성숙한 블록 체인을 목표로합니다.\r\n\r\n기술 혁신\r\n- 카르 다노 (Cardano)는 스테로이드 알고리즘에 대한 획기적인 증거인 Ouroboros를 통합 한 최초의 프로토콜입니다. IOHK 팀은 처음부터 Cardano를 구축하기위한 동료 검토 학술 연구에 힘 입어 \"1 차 원칙\"접근 방식을 채택했습니다.\r\n-이 독창적 인 공동 작업은 분산 시스템, 메커니즘 설계 및 암호화와 같은 분야를 하나로 모으는 제품인 cryptocurrency를 지속적으로 꾸준히 구축했습니다. 그 결과, 하스켈 코드에 기반한 최초의 암호 해독 성이 있습니다.이 코드는 업무 핵심 시스템에 필요한 복원력을 제공하는 산업 강도 제품으로이 경우 투자를 보호합니다.\r\n- Cardano의 다중 레이어 프로토콜은 고급 기능을 수행하고 제어 레이어에 우아하게 연결된 결제 레이어를 기반으로합니다. 결제 계층에는 계정 단위가 있고 제어 계층에는 스마트 계약이 실행되며 신원을 확인하고 규정 준수를 지원하도록 프로그램되어 (예 : 블랙리스트 허용)\r\n-이 프로토콜은 규제 기관의 요구를 고려하면서 사용자의 개인 정보 보호 권리를 보호하기위한 것입니다. 이렇게함으로써 Cardano는 이러한 요구 사항을 미묘하고 효과적인 방식으로 균형을 유지하는 최초의 프로토콜로서 cryptocurrencies에 대한 새로운 접근 방법을 개척했습니다.\r\n- 시스템은 소프트 포크를 통해 업그레이드 할 수 있도록 설계되어 필요에 따라 변화하는 요구 사항에 적응하고 신속하게 진화 할 수 있습니다. 의정서의 지속 가능성을 보장하는 재무 시스템도 설치되고 있습니다.\r\n- 완전 공개 소스 및 특허가없는 Cardano는 협업의 정신으로 만들어졌습니다. 효율성과 확장 성을 위해 설계된 Cardano 에코 시스템은 지금까지 구축 된 가장 완벽한 cryptocurrency로 발전 할 것입니다.\r\n\r\n개념적 혁신\r\n\r\n나는. 개인 정보 보호 및 규제\r\n원래의 Bitcoin 블록 체인은 개인이 은행과 정부의 통제를 벗어난 상태에서 서로 직접 익명으로 거래 할 수있는 방법이었습니다. 이는 금융 거래에서 프라이버시를 보장하며 근본적인 개인 권리입니다. 그러나 완전한 익명 성은 규제 적 감독이 부족한만큼 비생산적 일 수 있습니다. 오늘날 대부분의 블록 체인 프로젝트는 개인 정보 보호 또는 규제의 목표를 향해 나아갑니다. 전 세계적으로 효과를 발휘하기 위해 개인 정보 보호와 규정 통제를 적절히 혼합하여 블록 체인이 '원을 제곱'해야한다고 생각합니다.\r\n\r\nii. 통치\r\n공공적이고 분산 된 블록 체인 프로젝트는 군중 기반 거버넌스 모델에 의존합니다. 이를 통해 참여자들의 네트워크를 민주적으로 통제 할 수 있으며, 이는 진정으로 분산 된 경제를 구축하는 데 필수적입니다. 그러나 신중하게 설계하지 않으면 이러한 통제가 잘못 될 수 있습니다. 둘 다",

The group is contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\r\n\r\nEmurgo\r\n<a href=\"https://emurgo.io/\">Emurgo</a> is the venture building entity in the Cardano ecosystem, its goal is to aid, integrate, and foster Cardano blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nEmurgo captures the transformative power that blockchain technology brings to the developing world. Decentralized applications built on Cardano technology, funded and supported by Emurgo, will have the potential to build groundbreaking applications.\r\n\r\nProject Road Map\r\nIOHK has now released the settlement layer. This means you can transact, trade, and purchase Ada tokens fully independently of the computation layer. The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, users will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.\r\nIn 2019, IOHK intends to work on Cardano’s long-term scalability and augment its capabilities. As developers, IOHK has been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being adequately maintained. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem that is capable of funding and supporting itself."
